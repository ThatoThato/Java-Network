 A UDP-based peer-to-peer file sharing system which
 consists of a Client that can either send files (Seeder mode) or receive files (Leecher mode).
 Once a client starts, it asks the user for which mode the client will be making use of. The
 user can then continue sending or receiving binary files depending on what mode it is in, until
 the user terminates the connection by closing the client.
